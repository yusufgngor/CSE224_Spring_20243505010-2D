# Two's Complement Calculator (P1)

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple but fundamental digital circuit: a two's complement calculator. The design converts an 8-bit binary input to its two's complement representation, which is a mathematical operation commonly used in digital systems for representing negative numbers.

## Functionality

The two's complement of a binary number is calculated by:
1. Inverting all bits (changing 0s to 1s and vice versa)
2. Adding 1 to the result

This operation is implemented in a single line of Verilog code:
```verilog
assign out = ~in + 1;
```

## Features

- **8-bit Input/Output**: Processes 8-bit binary numbers
- **Combinational Logic**: Pure combinational circuit with no clock requirements
- **Simple Implementation**: Minimal gate count for efficient area usage
- **Pin Configuration**: Input pins on west side, output pins on east side
